&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;(To JS/07 M 378&lt;br /&gt;
This Marble Monument&lt;br /&gt;
Is Erected by the State)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He was found by the Bureau of Statistics to be&lt;br /&gt;
One against whom there was no official complaint,&lt;br /&gt;
And all the reports on his conduct agree&lt;br /&gt;
That, in the modern sense of an old-fashioned word, he was a saint,&lt;br /&gt;
For in everything he did he served the Greater Community.&lt;br /&gt;
Except for the War till the day he retired&lt;br /&gt;
He worked in a factory and never got fired,&lt;br /&gt;
But satisfied his employers, Fudge Motors Inc.&lt;br /&gt;
Yet he wasn’t a scab or odd in his views,&lt;br /&gt;
For his Union reports that he paid his dues,&lt;br /&gt;
(Our report on his Union shows it was sound)&lt;br /&gt;
And our Social Psychology workers found&lt;br /&gt;
That he was popular with his mates and liked a drink.&lt;br /&gt;
The Press are convinced that he bought a paper every day&lt;br /&gt;
And that his reactions to advertisements were normal in every way.&lt;br /&gt;
Policies taken out in his name prove that he was fully insured,&lt;br /&gt;
And his Health-card shows he was once in hospital but left it cured.&lt;br /&gt;
Both Producers Research and High-Grade Living declare&lt;br /&gt;
He was fully sensible to the advantages of the Installment Plan&lt;br /&gt;
And had everything necessary to the Modern Man,&lt;br /&gt;
A phonograph, a radio, a car and a frigidaire.&lt;br /&gt;
Our researchers into Public Opinion are content&lt;br /&gt;
That he held the proper opinions for the time of year;&lt;br /&gt;
When there was peace, he was for peace:  when there was war, he went.&lt;br /&gt;
He was married and added five children to the population,&lt;br /&gt;
Which our Eugenist says was the right number for a parent of his generation.&lt;br /&gt;
And our teachers report that he never interfered with their education.&lt;br /&gt;
Was he free? Was he happy? The question is absurd:&lt;br /&gt;
Had anything been wrong, we should certainly have heard.&lt;/p&gt;</content><summary type="html">By W. H.

Bullshit.&lt;br /&gt;
Tell that to the woman sitting by the window&lt;br /&gt;
wistfully gazing at the breakwaters below&lt;br /&gt;
knowing that she’ll never see Portugal again.&lt;br /&gt;
