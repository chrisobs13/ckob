The station wagon idles  
its exhaust curling  
into the thin January air  
like the cigarette smoke  
of the orderlies  
huddled on the loading dock.  
They wheel her out the automatic door  
and into the front seat  
gingerly positioning the oxygen tank  
between her legs.  

Her eyes tear up slightly as we say goodbye,  
"because it's so cold out here."  
If she knew this is how it would end  
would she have done anything differently?
  
"88 years is a long time," they say.  
"She's had a good life."  
Bullshit.  
Tell that to the woman sitting by the window  
wistfully gazing at the breakwaters below  
knowing that she'll never see Portugal again.  
Asking herself,  
"What would I have done differently?"
