It is summertime and you are five.  
You run, tumbling  
Into ocean water  
So salty that it burns  
The cuts on your knees.

It is summertime and you are five.  
You fling seaweed, laughing  
At your cousins  
The ones from out of state  
That you rarely see.

It is summertime and you are five.  
Your grandma watches, smiling  
Making a rare appearance  
In her rubber swim cap  
And frilly one-piece suit.

It is summertime and you are five.  
The lifeguard looks on, distracted  
Planning which boy to meet tonight  
Blissfully ignorant that this is the best job  
She will ever have.
