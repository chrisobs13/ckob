<p>The station wagon idles<br />
its exhaust curling<br />
into the thin January air<br />
like the cigarette smoke<br />
of the orderlies<br />
huddled on the loading dock.<br />
They wheel her out the automatic door<br />
and into the front seat<br />
gingerly positioning the oxygen tank<br />
between her legs.</p>

<p>Her eyes tear up slightly as we say goodbye,<br />
“because it’s so cold out here.”<br />
If she knew this is how it would end<br />
would she have done anything differently?</p>

<p>“88 years is a long time,” they say.<br />
“She’s had a good life.”<br />
Bullshit.<br />
Tell that to the woman sitting by the window<br />
wistfully gazing at the breakwaters below<br />
knowing that she’ll never see Portugal again.<br />
Asking herself,<br />
“What would I have done differently?”</p>
